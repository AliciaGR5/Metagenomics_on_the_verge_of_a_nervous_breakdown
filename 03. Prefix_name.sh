# This script is designed to rename bins files. It is perfect for SqueezeMeta (v1.6.2post3) SQM_project/results/bins folder. 
# You will need a directory.txt (with the names of the directory) and a samples.txt (with the names of the samples or the names you want to put as a prefix in your new bins)
