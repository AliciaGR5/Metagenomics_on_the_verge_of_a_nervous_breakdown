:tropical_drink: Drink this gazpacho, and you'll understand metagenomics in a second :tropical_drink:

===========================================================================

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION:** These scripts are for:
  + SqueezeMeta v.1.6.2post3 
  + Bash v.4.4.20

===========================================================================

### [01. Change_name.sh](https://github.com/AliciaGR5/Metagenomics_on_the_verge_of_a_nervous_breakdown/blob/main/01.%20Change_name.sh)
This script is designed to rename the bins in a CheckM file. It is perfect for SqueezeMeta (v1.6.2post3) table 17.*.checkM located in intermediate folder.
Now you can concatenate all the files you want without having repeated names for different bins. 
You will need a files.txt (with the files you want to change) and samples.txt (with the names of the samples or the names you want to put in your new bins).
